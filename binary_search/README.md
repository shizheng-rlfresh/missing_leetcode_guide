### Overview
For binary search, there exists a universal invariant which dominates the `search` per se:

Let's say, we might be getting 

```python

```

There are three `hypothesis patterns` for `binary search`:
1. Boundary Search
2. Predicate Search
3. Partition Search

To illustrate each of these patterns, we will define a pseudocode template and list a few original LC problems for each of them.
